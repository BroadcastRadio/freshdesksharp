# FreshdeskDotNet
FreshdeskDotNet is a .NET wrapper for the Freshdesk API.  It utilizes the v2 version of the API.  This repository was initially created by [Greg Cobb](http://www.developerstome.com) in order to meet the needs of DBA Software in supporting our [DBA Manufacturing](https://www.dbamanufacturing.com) customers.  Because of this, at this time it does not fully cover the entire Freshdesk API surface.  If you find yourself wanting to use this library, but need additional API endpoints to be added to be able to do so, please put in an issue and I will try my best to accommodate you.
